## General plan
* Decide on clear syntax for the language, and articulate the rules carefully.
* We will compile and run the totem source code from the command line.
* We will piggyback on an open source C compiler to compile and run totem.
* We therefore need to translate totem source into C source code.
* We can split the task into three sections: writing the core library (in C), writing the rest of the standard library (in totem), and writing the basic compiler. 

## GitHub Commit Guidelines
* Commits should be a short (50 characters or less) summary of changes. 
* Don't end the line with a full stop. 
* Use the imperative ("Add" instead of "Added", "Change" instead of "Changed").

## Object-oriented features to implement
* Abstraction
* Single Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Access Control
* Polymorphism

## Other features to implement
* Libraries/Packages that are easy to use.
* Garbage collection.
* Comments use the hash key.
* Core class library written in C.
* Standard class library written in totem.


## Miscellaneous - Keep Random Ideas Here!
* Plan to run totem code in the command line.
* Maybe learn how to use GitHub issues / projects but for now keep simple.
* Simplify access modifiers so that most likely modifiers are default.
* Write some sample totem code to get idea of what we want the syntax to be like.
* Spinning top logo.
* Write a syntax.md file but later expand.
* Perhaps add a nicer interface rather than just command line.
* Decide which parts of the syntax to enforce (spacing, naming conventions etc).
* Repository is described by GitHub as GCC Machine Description - why?
